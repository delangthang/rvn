The Kiss II Portal Engine is the part of the my Stargate Portal that does the actual work.

All unnecessary code (frills and mods) have been removed to produce a clean, uncluttered portal engine...

The Kiss Engine is fully integrated, it is not simply an extra page (unlike all other portals)...

All blocks (the basic method of collecting and display additional information used by most portals) can be added to all phpBB and Mod pages...

The initial block positioning and visibility is set by the administrator on a group basics...
Members can further arrange blocks using Drag & Drop and hide or show individual blocks as desired...

History:
The Kiss Portal Engine started life as the Kiss Portal, later renamed to the Stargate Portal...
Development began during the early Alpha phase of phpBB3 back around 2005...
